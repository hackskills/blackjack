# A Simple Blackjack Game

This is a simple blackjack game that I implemented to run on the UNIX terminal.

### Rules
The rules can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack). 

### How the Game Works
The game can handle up to 7 players, although more players can be added by modifying the code. Each player starts with $100 and the game will continue for as long as there is a player who still has money.
